Hi 👋, I'm Chandrashekhar Singh Mourya

A Dynamic, dedicated and determined individual who seeks to reach the maximum potential in all aspects of my life. Both hardworking and proactive, I enjoy giving 100% to all I do, including actively seeking out opportunities that may benefit me or seizing the day as it comes. 

As a first generation scholar, I would like to say I am familiar to the views of those who may view the world in a different light. My interests include looking at how the world can be a more inclusive place (especially regarding protected characteristics) and allowing those who may not have access to certain opportunities gain such fairer access. In doing so, I am a strong advocate of equality, fair opportunity and inclusivity. I am seeking a career path in such field, and would love to connect with anyone regarding this work. 

In my spare time, I enjoy public speaking competitions, socializing and being a part of the cheer-leading team. Alongside my degree, I work part time in research, as well as I am also a personal tutor, in the subjects of Math's, English and Science hence I am no stranger to hard work and grafting.

I am passionate about learning things and developing myself in order to be a Champion one day! “The way to ‘get there’ is to ‘be there’, just be where you choose to get!”.

Hobbies:
I like to teach and mentor others who are in need. Also enjoy travelling, driving and swimming
